      black teas are usually brewed for about four minutes. In many
      regions of the world, actively boiling water is used and the tea
      is often stewed. In India, black tea is often boiled for fifteen
      minutes or longer to make Masala chai, as a strong brew is
      preferred. Tea is often strained while serving.`,

        Yixing purple clay teapots are the traditional brewing-vessel for
        oolong tea which can be brewed multiple times from the same
        leaves, unlike green tea, seeming to improve with reuse. In the
        southern Chinese and Taiwanese Gongfu tea ceremony, the first brew
        is discarded, as it is considered a rinse of leaves rather than a
        proper brew.`,
